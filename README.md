# Why use TypeScript?

- Type checking at compile time is way better than things crashing or behaving unexpectedly at run time.

- You get a better development experience because autocomplete knows more about what you're intending on doing.

- Large codebases stay more maintainable because you're able to put guardrails on how your code can be used.
